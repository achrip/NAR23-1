# Binary Search Tree
is a Tree that has a maximum of two branches/childs. The way that the data are handled to the binary tree is: 
* If there is no preceding data available, the first data will become root
* If there is a preceding data available, there are two cases: 
** If inputted data > existing data in root/branch -> data will go into the right branch.
** If inputted data < existing data in root/branch -> data will go to into the left branch.
